%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Cloud-native services have evolved from monolithic architectures to microservices, comprising hundreds to thousands of containerized components.  
These microservices are launched frequently and collaborate closely, and each must meet strict requirements for responsiveness and availability.
To satisfy service-level agreements (SLAs), monitoring plays a critical role in microservices. 
To enable an orchestration system to manage each microservice effectively, monitoring services must operate with both low latency and low overhead, allowing them to capture timely service status without compromising service performance.
However, conventional user-space monitoring tools such as Netdata and Prometheus incur scheduling delays and context switch overhead, resulting in increased monitoring latency and degraded service performance.

We present X-Monitor, a lightweight monitoring framework based on eXpress Data Path (XDP).  
X-Monitor has three key features:  
(1) In-kernel monitoring achieves low overhead by eliminating user-kernel context switches, as both packet processing and metric collection are performed entirely within the kernel.  
(2) SoftIRQ-level execution enables low-latency monitoring by reducing delay in executing these monitoring tasks without incurring scheduling latency and with minimal preemption.
(3) Programmable metric selection enables flexible in-kernel monitoring via user-defined XDP programs.
Our evaluation using Memcached and YCSB demonstrates that X-Monitor reduces the 99.9th percentile monitoring latency by two orders of magnitude and mitigates throughput degradation by up to 11.8\% compared to traditional monitoring systems.

%Cloud-native applications have shifted from monolithic architectures to microservices composed of hundreds to thousands of containerized components.  
%These microservices collaborate closely, and each must meet strict requirements for responsiveness and reliability where services are frequently created or updated.

% \begin{abstract}
% Cloud services are increasingly shifting from monolithic architectures to microservices-based designs.
% As modern applications consist of hundreds to thousands of microservices, effective monitoring is crucial to ensure proper management and control while meeting Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
% Given the highly dynamic nature of microservices—frequently created and destroyed in short intervals—a monitoring system must (1) provide real-time visibility into service status and (2) impose minimal interference on running services.

% In this paper, we propose a lightweight monitoring system leveraging eXpress Data Path (XDP) framework.
% Our system offers three key advantages: (1) low overhead by eliminating user-kernel context switches during metric collection, (2) low latency through execution in the SoftIRQ layer, avoiding delays from scheduling and synchronization, and (3) flexible programmability, allowing fine-grained control over which monitoring data to collect.

% We demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces monitoring overhead compared to existing systems such as Netdata, while maintaining accurate and timely metric collection.
